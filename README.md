# Liri-Bot Week 10

## Synopsis
LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. I was not able to get the Twitter API keys however I was able to use the Spotify and OMDB API's for this project. For this application to work you simply need to upload your own .env folder to the cloned project.

## Tech Used
    -Node.js
    -JavaScript
    -Spotify API
    -OMDB API
